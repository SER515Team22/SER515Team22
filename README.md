Source code for project by team 22


For working software please use the development branch. The development branch has the updated final code. We have decided to push the working final software to master in the end, till then development will act as the working branch.


Steps to run the code - 
1) Install node.js using this link https://nodejs.org/en/download/

2) Once Node is installed install electron using command "npm install" on node console.

3) Clone the repo (development branch has final working code) in the system and run using command "npm start". 
This will open the electron window and run the software.
